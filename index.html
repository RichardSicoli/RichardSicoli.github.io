            <p class="lead">
            I'm Richard Sicoli. I am currently a graduate student at Stony Brook University, where I am majoring in computer science. I’ve been developing apps since freshman year of high school. Since embarking on my journey of software development, I have produced numerous apps and even founded my own company. </p>

            <p class="lead">
            I am also immensely passionate about machine learning and deep learning. Specifically, my current areas of research are in computer vision and natural language processing. I am currently a research assistant at Stony Brook University, under the guidance of <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/" target="_blank"> Prof.  Niranjan Balasubramanian </a>.

            <h3>GameFuse, LLC</h3>
            <h5 class="text-muted">2011 - 2014</h5>
            <p class="lead">I have developed 3 iOS games through my indie game development company, GameFuse, LLC, which I founded back in high school. These apps were <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-runner-lite/id459638716?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank"> Star Runner </a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazing-paddle/id439608788?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank"> Amazing Paddle </a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/6-colors/id662582623?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank"> 6 Colors </a>. I also developed a custom physics engine in Objective-C for these games, <a href="Frost2D FrameworkDocumentation.pdf" target="_blank"> Frost2D </a>. </p>
            <p class="lead"> This experience marked the start of my journey into software development. Most importantly, it allowed me to develop very strong skills in algorithms, physics, networking (TCP/UDP), code optimization/memory management, human-computer interaction, and design strategies.</p>

            <h5 class="text-muted">2013 - 2015</h5>
            <p class="lead">I was hired during my first semester at college as a software engineer for a startup at the <a href="https://www.cewit.org/" target="_blank"> Center of Excellence in Wireless & Information Technology </a> (CEWIT). I worked with <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~borodin/" target="_blank"> Yevgen Borodin </a> and a team of researchers and engineers on the app, <a href="https://www.captivoice.com/capti-site/" target="_blank"> Capti </a>. Capti allows people to listen to content on the web by extracting webpage content and adding it to a playlist. The app features a heavy focus on accessibility for people with vision impairments. I worked on the iOS app, including the interfaces, Core Data, landscape and iPad support, text to speech system, and the custom browser.</p>
            <p class="lead">My experience at Charmtech allowed me to develop skills in source control managment, teamwork, browsers, web technologies, databases, speech synthesis and software accessibilty. I found the experience working with accessibilty to be the most interesting due to the real-world impact it can have on people. In fact, Capti won the 2014 FCC Chairman's Award for Advancing Accessibility in the category of Mobile Web Browsers </p>

            <h5 class="text-muted">2017 - 2018</h5>
            <p class="lead">Currently working as a research assistant with <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/" target="_blank"> Prof.  Niranjan Balasubramanian</a>, on a privacy system. The system uses machine learning for entity-level sentiment analysis to find a user's view towards the people or places they read about online. </p>
            <p class="lead">
            The ultimate goal is to develop a local application that can inform a user of what can be learned from their personal information. The application could then recommend steps to preserve neutrality/anonymity.
